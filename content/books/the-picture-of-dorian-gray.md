**Summary:**<br>

Dorian Gray is a beautiful, innocent young man who falls prey to the seductive world of hedonism. As Dorian gives himself more and more to his pleasures, the question of what is good and what is evil becomes irrelevant. Not long after his cruel treatment of a young woman, Dorian notices a change in a portrait of himself. His image looks marred and not so beautiful and pure as when it was first given to him. As the years pass, Dorian remains young and beautifulâ€”his portrait, however, becomes utterly hideous.
