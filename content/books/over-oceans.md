**Summary:**<br>

Paris. Wimbledon. New York City. Tokyo. Melbourne. Kiev. Rome.

Krista Lyn White never imagined such an answer to her desperate prayer:
“God, what do You want me to do with my life? Just show me. I’ll do it.”

Krista Lyn White traveled for nearly ten years on the professional tennis tour, serving as a member of the community—yet without the usual qualifications to be there. She learned to adapt to the many cultures on the tour and found ways to befriend those who didn’t share her faith in God. 

_Over Oceans_ is a spectacular memoir of surrender and miraculous provision, and a revelatory look at the power of God's ever-redeeming, never-tiring, always-victorious love on individuals hesitant to believe.
